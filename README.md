# Apollo_Swift_Example

This is a simple example about how to use Apollo in Swift.

## How to run the demo

1. Pods are ignored, run pod install before compile
```swift 
$pod install
```

2. This demo is using github API, relace token inside `AppDelegate.swift` with your own one.

    `github -> settings ->  developer settings -> personal access tokens`


## How To Install Apollo
